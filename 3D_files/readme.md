# 3D Files for PWM-Light

This folder contains the **3D models** (Fusion 360 design files, STL exports, and any additional resources) used to create the enclosure or other mechanical parts for the **PWM-light** project. The models are designed to be **FDM-friendly**, requiring minimal supports, and are easily adaptable for various 3D printers and use cases.

## Contents

- **Fusion 360 Source Files**  
  - Editable design files for further enhancements or customizations. If you need to change dimensions, mounting points, or aesthetics, simply open these in Autodesk Fusion 360 (or a compatible CAD tool) and modify as needed.

- **STL Files**  
  - Ready-to-print mesh files exported from the Fusion 360 models. These can be opened in your preferred slicing software (e.g., PrusaSlicer, Cura, Simplify3D) to generate G-code for your 3D printer.

- **Additional Docs/Images (if provided)**  
  - Any reference pictures, exploded views, or supplementary instructions specific to assembling the printed parts.

## Printing Recommendations

- **Minimal Supports**: The models are structured to minimize or even eliminate the need for supports, saving on material and print time.
- **Material Choice**:  
  - **PLA** is a common choice for indoor use, providing ease of printing and cost-effectiveness.  
  - **PETG** is recommended if you need more heat or impact resistance.
- **Infill & Perimeters**: Adjust infill percentage and perimeter count based on your durability requirements. For typical enclosures, an **infill of 10–20%** and 2–3 perimeters often suffice.

## Assembly Notes

1. **Mounting Hardware**: In most cases, M3 screws or self-tapping screws are used to secure boards, panels, or lids.  
2. **Access to Ports & Vents**: Ensure your final print properly aligns with cutouts for cables, power, or ventilation.  
3. **Combining with Electronics**: This enclosure is specifically designed for the **PWM-light** PCB and related components as described in the main repository. However, you can also adapt it for other electronics if needed.

## Modifying the Design

- The **Fusion 360** files are provided for easy editing.  
- Feel free to **remix** the enclosure to fit different boards, additional sensors, or custom cutouts.  
- If you improve or redesign the models, consider contributing your modifications back to this project!

## Usage & License

- These design files are offered under the **GPL-3.0** license, similar to the rest of the project.  
- You’re free to share, modify, and build upon the designs, as long as you provide the same freedoms to others and acknowledge the original source.
